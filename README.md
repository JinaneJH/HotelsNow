# HotelsNow

You can use this repository to do the following tasks :

1- Use Tripadvisor API to get a list of hotels along with their information, for a specific destination, a checkin date and checkout date

2- Scrape reviews'ratings and texts for each hotel selected by tripadvisor; only hotels listed on the first page are considered (around 30 hotels). A csv file containing the hotels along with their reviews' texts and ratings is generated.

3- Rank hotels based on their reviews' ratings using the percentile rank of 4 and chi-square statistic

4- Analyze the reviews's texts for each hotel, extract the polarity scores for the hotel features, such as location, service, etc.
