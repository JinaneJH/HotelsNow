# HotelsNow


The information provided by hotels booking websites, such as TripAdvisor.com, 
in the form of ratings and reviews is not accurate enough to help users to easily make quick decisions.
This problem is mainly due to the fact that hotels are often accompanied by a long history of reviews and ratings. 
In addition, the information contained therein is outdated and obfuscates the recent ratings and sentiments.

In this project, I propose to provide the user with a search option, that enables to control the timeframe of reviews. 
Based on this timeframe, the user will get a list of hotels ranked by an appropriate statistical measure
of the reviews' ratings (the often used average value is not a proper measure for an ordinal variable such as the rating) 
and for each hotel, the up-to-date sentiments of the hotel features (such as the hotel cleanliness, service, etc.).
